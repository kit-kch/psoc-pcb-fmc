# PSoC FMC Extension PCB

This repository contains schematic, layout and BOM for the PSoC FMC extension PCB.
The PCB provides all peripherals that are used to realize the [PSoC Audio Player](https://kch.dev/psoc).
It is primarily meant to be used with the Zedboard for FPGA prototyping, but it can also serve as a test board for the PSoC ASIC.

## Ordering the PCBs

PCBs were ordered from [aisler](aisler.net) using the [fab.zip](fab.zip) file.
Make sure to use a stencil with 150Âµm thickness for proper FMC connector soldering.

## Note and Limitations

### JTAG

* The board unfortunately does not provide convenient access to JTAG pins, although the debug header can be used.
  As a workaround, [psoc-pcb-jtag](https://github.com/kit-kch/psoc-pcb-jtag) can be connected to the USB header.

### Powering the IHP ASIC

The [IHP SG13G2 ASIC](https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/TO_Sep2025/pull/4) requires an 1.2V source instead of the 1.8V on this board.
Although the regulator on the board is adjustable, it can't go down to 1.2V.

As a simple solution, some parts can be replaced to provide 1.2V output:
* `U7` with `TLV76112DCYR` 1A 1.2V regulator
* `R51` with 0 Ohm (short)
* Remove `R50`
* Remove `C26`
